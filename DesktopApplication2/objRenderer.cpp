// objRenderer
// Version 3.1
//
// Description
// The project objRenderer parses a single 3D object's description from a Wavefront .obj file, and renders that object one or more times.
// Implemented:
// - Object geometry
// - Light
//
// This program, objRenderer, renders the object.
// This program is a C++ Windows Desktop application using the Windows (Win32) API and the DirectX 11 API.
//
// All variables and functions coded in HLSL (.hlsl files) are stored in GPU memory.
// All variables and functions coded in C++ (.cpp files) are stored in CPU memory.
//
// Authorship
// This program is based on "DirectX 11 Win32 Desktop: Direct3D: Moving to 3D: Lesson 3: Simple Modeling" and earlier lessons by Chris Hanson (http://DirectXTutorial.com).
// All defects in this program are solely the responsibility of Robert John Tortorelli.

// Terminology
//   Textures:
//   The word texture has two distinct meanings in DirectX programming. Both meanings are used in this program.
//
//   1. The terms texture, texture image, and image texture refers to a computer graphics image applied to the surface of a 3D object.
//      A texel (a texture element or texture pixel) is the fundamental unit of a texture map.
//      Textures are represented by arrays of texels representing the texture space, just as other images are represented by arrays of pixels.
//      A mipmap (also MIP map) or pyramid is a pre-calculated, optimized sequences of images, each of which is a progressively lower resolution representation of the previous image.
//      The CreateWICTextureFromFile function is one way to create a texture from an image file, such as a .png file.
//
//   2. The terms texture buffer, texture array, and texture interface refer to DirectX programming constructs.
//      These terms are distinct from the term texture images defined above.

	//***
	// 3. Create the constant buffer object and set it to the vertex shader stage of the graphics pipeline.
	//		Multiple constant buffers can be created (see below) and each can be set to the vertex shader and/or pixel shader stage of the graphics pipeline, depending on how it will be used.
	//      Constant buffers are optimized for constant variable usage, which is characterized by lower-latency access and more frequent update from the CPU.
	//      Constant buffers are used to store data that is shared by all shaders in the graphics pipeline.
	//      The size of the constant buffer resource must be a multiple of 16 bytes, because constants are sent to the GPU in packs of 16 bytes, regardless of the size of the C++ constant buffer structure.
	//      A constant buffer can be a structure containing multiple constants. The order and size of these structure's members must match in both C++ and HLSL.
	//      Any one constant (structure member) cannot be split between two 16-byte areas of memory. Therefore, if the first constant in the structure is less than 16 bytes then the second constant will be aligned on the next 16-byte boundary. When it occurs, this automatic alignment must be accounted for in the C++ constant buffer structure in C++, otherwise it will not match the HLSL constant buffer structure, even if their code looks identical.
	//
	//      These structures and their members are optionally named the same in C++ and HLSL.
	//      The C++ constant buffer structure is copied to the constant buffer pointed to by pCBuffer using the ID3D11DeviceContext::UpdateSubresource member function.
	//      Copying to the constant buffer always provides		  position information for the object rendered, as it does in this program.
	//      Copying to the constant buffer may optionally provide scene    information for the object rendered, such as lighting information, timing information, among other details.
	//      A constant buffer's information should be sent to the GPU only as needed, matching its frequency of update. For example, if position information and scene information are updated at different frequencies (at different times), then create two constant buffers, one for position information and one for scene information.
	//
	//    Constant buffer and texture buffer shader constants:
	//      In Shader Model 4 (used in this program), shader constants are stored in one or more buffer resources in memory. They can be organized into two types of buffer: constant buffers (cbuffer) and texture buffers (tbuffer).
	//
	//      Constant buffers are optimized for constant-variable usage, which is characterized by lower-latency access and more frequent update from the CPU.
	//      A constant buffer is a specialized buffer resource that is accessed like a buffer. Each constant buffer can hold up to 4096 vectors; each vector contains up to four 32-bit values. You can bind up to 14 constant buffers per graphics pipeline stage (2 additional slots are reserved for internal use).
	//      A constant buffer does not require a view to be bound to the pipeline.
	//
	//      Texture buffers are accessed like textures and perform better for arbitrarily indexed data.
	//      A texture buffer is a specialized buffer resource that is accessed like a texture. Texture access (as compared with standard buffer access) can have better performance for arbitrarily indexed data. You can bind up to 128 texture buffers per graphics pipeline stage.
	//      A texture buffer requires a view and must be bound to a texture slot (or must be bound with SetTextureBuffer when using an effect).
	//
	//      Regardless of which type of resource you use, there is no limit to the number of constant buffers or texture buffers a program can create.
	//
	//      A buffer resource is designed to minimize the overhead of setting shader constants.
	//        Manage buffer updates using:
	//        - The effect framework (see ID3D10Effect Interface)
	//        - The Direct3D API (see ID3D11DeviceContext::UpdateSubresource member function)
	//        - A program can also copy data from another buffer (such as a render target or a stream-output target) into a constant buffer.

	//    The final matrix, matFinal = matWorld x matView x matProjection
	//
	//   i.	Define the world matrix, matWorld.
	//		What is the purpose of the world transformation?
	//		A model-to-world transformation, colloquially called a world transformation (or model transformation), converts model geometric vertices to world coordinates.
	//		In other words, it places a model in a world at an exact point defined by coordinates, and involves:
	//		1. Translation (movement)
	//		   It's defined by a single matrix (matTranslate), using a single DirectX function (XMMatrixTranslation).
	//		2. Rotation
	//		   It's defined by a single matrix (matRotate) that is itself defined by one to three matrices (matRotateX, matRotateY and / or matRotateZ), using one to three DirectX functions for x, y, and / or z axis rotation (XMMatrixRotationX, XMMatrixRotationY, and / or XMMatrixRotationZ).
	//		   If there are multiple rotation matrices, these are multiplied together to define matRotate.
	//		3. Scaling
	//		   It's defined by a single matrix (matScale), using a single DirectX function (XMMatrixScaling).
	//		World Matrix (matWorld) Examples:
	//		  matWorld = matScale x matRotateX
	//		  matWorld = matRotate x matScale x matTranslate (translate last, which is most commonly used)
	//		  matWorld = matTranslate x matRotate x matScale (translate first, providing a different result because when it is used first it offsets the object from the origin (0, 0, 0) before rotation takes place relative to the origin)
	//
	//  ii.	Define the view matrix, matView.
	//		What is the purpose of the view transformation?
	//		The view transformation converts model geometric vertices to view coordinates.
	//		View transformation can be considered similar to setting up a virtual camera, and involves:
	//		1. Position of the camera
	//		2. Location the camera is looking at
	//		3. Orientation of the camera
	//		   This is the direction of "up" for the camera; i.e., the direction pointing to the top of the screen. Usually, game programmers use the y-axis as the "up" direction.
	//		   To orient the camera this way, specify (0, 1, 0), or 1 on the y axis and 0 on the x and z axes; i.e., (0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f).
	//		4. It's defined by a single matrix (matView), using a single DirectX function (XMMatrixLookAtLH).
	//
	// iii. Define the projection matrix, matProjection.
	//		What is the purpose of the projection transformation?
	//		The projection transformation converts model geometric vertices to screen coordinates.
	//		Projection transformation can be considered similar to setting up a camera lens, and involves:
	//		1. Field of View
	//		   In 3D graphics, the field of view is defined by setting the amount of radians allowed (vertically). The standard amount for this is 0.78539 (which is pi/4 radians, or 45 degrees).
	//		2. View-Plane Clipping
	//		   View-plane clipping omits the parts of an image that are unnecessary to draw; e.g., parts too far to see because of fog or the horizon.
	//		   Direct3D asks for a near view-plane and a far view-plane, and only draws the graphics that are between them; i.e., in the viewing frustum.
	//		3. It's defined by a single matrix (matProjection), using a single DirectX function (XMMatrixPerspectiveFovLH).
	//		   However, it's probably the most complex type of transformation, and the underlying math performed by the DirectX function is complicated.
	//
	//  iv.	Define the final transformation matrix, matFinal.
	//		matFinal = matWorld x matView x matProjection
	//		Each geometric vertex is multiplied by the final transformation matrix.
	//		The final transformation matrix is one member of the C++ constant buffer structure that matches the HLSL constant buffer structure. The C++ constant buffer structure will be copied to the HLSL constant buffer structure (they are, but do not have to be, named the same).
	//		Using the HLSL constant buffer is efficient, as multiplication and other common operations can be performed on its members by the GPU's vertex shader.
	//***
